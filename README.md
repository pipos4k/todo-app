# Simple CRUD App with Flask

This is a basic backend CRUD application built with Flask for the **DevReady Bootcamp**!

## What it does

- **Create** new items
- **Read** and view existing items  
- **Update** and **Delete** will come soon!

## API Endpoints

- `GET /items` - Get all items as JSON
- `GET /items/<id>` - Get specific item by ID
- `GET /items/status/<status>` - Filter items by status
 
Basically, it's a simple list manager where you can add and view items.

## What I used

- Python
- Flask
- HTML/CSS

## How to run it

1. Clone the repo on your machine. <br/>
`git clone https://github.com/pipos4k/todo-app.git`
2. Install Flask <br/>
`pip install flask`
3. Run the app: <br/>
`python3 todo-app.py`
4. Open http://localhost:5001 in your browser

## Note

This is my first bootcamp project so... Feedback is welcome!
